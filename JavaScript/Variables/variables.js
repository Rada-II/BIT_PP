/*Variable declaration and initialization
1. Create several variable using different letter cases and beginning characters. Check if they
still exist if you refer to them in different case - does case matter here? Try to declare a letiable
starting with number as the first character. */


let month = "october";
let todays_Date = 5;
const doingHomework = true;

console.log(month);
console.log(todays_Date);
console.log(doingHomework);

/*2. Save a string (text) describing your current mood in a letiable and print it out in console.*/

let currentMood = "I am feeling great!"
console.log(currentMood);

/*3. Feel free to play around in the console and get familiar with it. */

let myName = "Rada";
let myMood = "is awesome";
let myString = "Hello, name is" + " " + myName + " " + "and my mood" + " " + myMood + "!";

console.log(myString)
