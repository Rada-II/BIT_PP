    <h1>Exercise 1 (prototype)</h1>
    <p>
      a)Create a Car class with properties (brand, model, motion) and methods
      (check motion, accelerate, break). Check motion method should check the
      speed and returns if the car are in move or not (speed is greater than
      zero). Accelerate method should increase the speed for some number we
      provide. Break method should decrease the speed for the number we provided
      (pay attention if the speed is negative number after decreasing).
    </p>

    <p>
      b) Add the status method that displays all current data for the car
      (model, brand, motion state, speed => something like "Ford Mondeo is
      running at 150km/h, car is moving").
    </p>
    <p>
      c) Add a new method to stop the car immediately (set the speed to 0). It
      doesn't need parameters.
    </p>
    <p>d) Create a 3 car objects and test it!</p>
